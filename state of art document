## Project Overview
The HR Management System is a web application developed with Django to streamline human resource processes, enabling efficient management of employee records, leave requests, attendance tracking, and payroll.

## Objectives
Automate HR tasks to enhance efficiency.
Ensure secure and accurate management of employee data.
Provide a user-friendly interface for easy navigation.

## System Architecture
The application follows a three-tier architecture:
Presentation Layer: Front end built with HTML and CSS.
Application Layer: Business logic handled by Django views and models.
Data Layer: SQLite (for development) and PostgreSQL (for production) databases.

## Technological Stack
Backend: Django (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for styling)
Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL
Libraries: Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication and ORM tools.

## Core Functionalities
Employee Management: Create, read, update, and delete employee records.
Leave Management: Employees can apply for leave, and HR can approve or reject requests.
Attendance Tracking: Log and view daily attendance for employees.

##User Roles and Access Control
Admin/HR: Full access to manage all features.
Manager: Limited access to approve leave and review attendance.
Employee: Access to their own records and leave applications.

##Design Considerations
Data Security: Role-based access to protect sensitive information.
Scalability: Designed to grow with the organization.
User Experience: Intuitive UI for ease of use.

## Database Design
Employee Model: Stores personal and job-related information.
Leave Model: Manages leave requests and statuses.
Attendance Model: Tracks daily attendance for employees.

## Workflow and User Interactions
Users log in to access their dashboards, where they can manage their information, apply for leave, and check attendance. HR personnel manage employee records and process leave requests.

##Security Measures
Authentication: Secure login using Django's authentication system.
Role-Based Access: Permissions defined for different user roles to control data access.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
Conduct unit tests for individual components and integration tests for workflows to ensure reliability and performance.

## Deployment and Future Enhancements
Deployment: Host on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.
Future Enhancements: Self-service portal for employees, advanced reporting, and mobile app integration.
